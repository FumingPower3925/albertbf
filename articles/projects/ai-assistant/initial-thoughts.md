# Building an AI Assistant

I've been exploring the idea of building a personal AI assistant that prioritizes privacy and runs locally. Here are my initial thoughts and research.

## Motivation

Current AI assistants have several limitations:

1. **Privacy concerns**: Data sent to cloud services
2. **Internet dependency**: Require constant connectivity
3. **Limited customization**: Can't tailor to specific needs
4. **Cost**: Subscription fees for advanced features

## Approach

### Local-First Architecture

The assistant should run entirely on local hardware:

- **Offline operation**: No internet required for core functions
- **Data privacy**: All conversations stay local
- **Customizable**: Can be trained on personal data
- **Cost-effective**: One-time setup cost

### Technology Stack

Initial research suggests:

- **Ollama**: For running local LLMs
- **Whisper**: Speech-to-text processing
- **TTS Models**: Text-to-speech synthesis
- **RAG Pipeline**: Personal knowledge base integration

## Challenges

### Hardware Requirements

Local LLMs need significant resources:

- **Memory**: 16GB+ RAM for decent models
- **Storage**: Models can be 4GB+ each
- **Compute**: GPU acceleration preferred

### Model Selection

Balancing capability vs. resource usage:

- **Large models**: Better performance, higher requirements
- **Small models**: Faster, less capable
- **Specialized models**: Task-specific optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype**: Basic chat interface with Ollama
2. **Integration**: Add speech and file processing
3. **Customization**: Train on personal documentation
4. **Optimization**: Improve speed and accuracy

## Research Questions

- Which model size provides the best balance?
- How to implement effective RAG for personal data?
- What's the best approach for multi-modal interactions?
- How to handle context window limitations?

This project is still in early exploration phase, but the potential for a truly personal, private AI assistant is exciting.

I'll document the journey as I build and experiment with different approaches.
