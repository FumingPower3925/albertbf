# Welcome to My Blog

This is my new personal blog built with a minimalist approach and Apple's beautiful "Liquid Glass" design aesthetic. The entire site is statically generated from Markdown files and served via Cloudflare Workers.

## Features

Here are some of the key features of this blog:

- **Static Generation**: All content is pre-built from Markdown files
- **Liquid Glass Design**: Beautiful glassmorphism effects with blurred backgrounds
- **Client-side Search**: Fast search without any backend queries
- **Project Organization**: Special handling for project-related articles
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all devices

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function that demonstrates the search functionality:

```javascript
function performSearch(query) {
  const results = searchIndex.filter(article => 
    article.title.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) ||
    article.content.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
  );
  
  displayResults(results);
}
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

1. Web development techniques
2. Design principles
3. Project breakdowns
4. Technology reviews
